# Portfolio Risk Assessment and Investment Strategy Optimization with yFinance Data Collection

This project aims to perform a portfolio risk assessment and optimize investment strategy using historical stock data collected from Yahoo Finance (yFinance). It includes data gathering, portfolio allocation, visualization, risk assessment, investment decision-making, and insights derived from the collected data.

## Data Gathering

The data collection is automated using the Yahoo Finance `yfinance` API to fetch historically adjusted closing prices for a specified list of stocks within a given time frame.

## Portfolio Allocation

Portfolio weights represent the distribution of assets within the portfolio. In this project, portfolio weights are predefined for a list of selected companies. Visualization of portfolio allocation is presented using a pie chart.

## Cumulative Returns

Cumulative returns for the portfolio are calculated and visualized to understand the overall performance over the specified time period.

## Daily Returns for Each Company

The distribution of daily returns for each company in the portfolio is visualized using box plots, providing insights into the volatility and performance of individual assets.

## Risk Assessment

Portfolio volatility, a measure of risk, is calculated and compared to a benchmark and an investor's risk tolerance. Recommendations for risk management and asset allocation adjustments are provided based on risk assessment findings.

## Investment Decision-making

Decisions regarding asset allocation, portfolio rebalancing, and risk management strategies are made based on risk assessment results and investment objectives.

## Insights from Collected Data

Insights are derived from the analysis, focusing on portfolio volatility assessment, risk assessment findings, and recommendations for future actions to optimize the investment strategy and manage risk effectively.

## Recommendations for Future Action

Guidance is provided for reassessing the portfolio's risk exposure, optimizing asset allocation, and implementing risk management techniques to achieve long-term investment goals.

## Conclusion

The project emphasizes the importance of managing portfolio volatility, aligning investment strategies with risk preferences, and continuously monitoring and adjusting portfolios to adapt to market conditions and investor objectives. By following proactive steps and staying informed, investors can navigate uncertainties and optimize their portfolios for sustainable returns while managing risks effectively.
